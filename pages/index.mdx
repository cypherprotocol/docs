# Why Cypher?

**Cypher** is an [on-chain](https://etherscan.org) hack prevention system.

It supports any smart contract that holds value, any signing technique [in the EVM](/get-started#sidebar-and-anchor-links), and maintains frictionless composability with other protocols.

## Statistics

## Why should you consider using it?

Cypher was built for one main purpose: stop hacks when they happen, not after. Our goal is to help you reduce the anxiety when deploying to main-net so you can focus on your business and its customers, not its threats.

We made it easy to interact with- once your protocol is created, you can include Cypher with a few lines of code and less than 5 minutes of integration time.

You can use it on any smart contract that stores value. Your team wants to add a new feature? Not a problem, we can ship with that feature too.

You'll have access to our team 24/7, 365. You'll get your own dedicated Telegram and Discord chat to talk to all members of our team.

We support seamless integration- we'll work with your development flow, and you don't need to change your protocol's architecture at all.

If you aren't satisfied with Cypher, we'll fully refund you and help migrate off our platform, to your old contracts.
