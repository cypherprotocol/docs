# Why Cypher?

**Cypher** is an [on-chain](https://etherscan.org) hack prevention system.

It supports any smart contract that holds value, any signing technique [in the EVM](/get-started#sidebar-and-anchor-links), and maintains frictionless composability with other protocols.

## Current state of smart contracts

Over the past year, there has been $3B+ stolen out of smart contracts, with Q1 2022 alone resulting in $682B+ in lost funds. It only increased from there, with Nomand losing $182M+, Mango Markets losing $150M+ and the recent BSC hack resulting in $500M+ lost ([more here](https://4irelabs.com/articles/top-17-smart-contract-hacks/)). These are all big numbers, but are dwarfed by the total amount lost over all ecosystems ([$27B+](https://hacked.slowmist.io/statistics/?c=all&d=all)).

If we are to realize a more financially inclusive and equal world, where people in the west can do business with people in Africa, South America, or Antarctica without delays, then there needs to be a tool to actively prevent hacks, not just notify you that they happened.

This is why we are building Cypher. To help protect those that are building this increasingly connected world.

## Would Cypher benefit you?

Cypher was built for one main purpose: stop hacks when they happen, not after. Our goal is to help you reduce the anxiety when deploying to mainnet so you can focus on your business and its customers, not its threats.

#### Ease of use

We made it easy to interact with - once your protocol is created, you can include Cypher with a few lines of code and less than 5 minutes of integration time.

#### Slutty software

You can use it on any smart contract that stores value. Your team wants to add a new feature? Not a problem, we can ship with that feature too.

#### Customer service

You'll have access to our team 24/7, 365. You'll get your own dedicated Telegram and Discord chat to talk to all members of our team.

#### Works with your architecture

We support seamless integration - we'll work with your development flow, and you don't need to change your protocol's architecture at all.

#### Satisfaction

If you aren't satisfied with Cypher, we'll fully refund you and help migrate off our platform and back to your old contracts.
