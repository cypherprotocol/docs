# Why Cypher?

**Cypher** is an [on-chain](https://etherscan.org) hack prevention system.

It supports any smart contract that holds value, any signing technique [in the EVM](/get-started#sidebar-and-anchor-links), and maintains frictionless composability with other protocols.

Nextra docs as example:
It supports Markdown and React components ([MDX](/features/mdx)), automatically generated [sidebar and anchor links](/get-started#sidebar-and-anchor-links), file-system based routing, built-in syntax highlighting, image optimization, custom layouts, i18n, and all the features you love about Next.js.
