## Installation

To install with [**Foundry**](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry):

```
forge install cypherprotocol/cypher-contracts
```

To install with [**Hardhat**](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat) or [**Truffle**](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle):

```
npm install cypher-contracts
```

To import manually, you can copy the source code [**here**](https://github.com/cypherprotocol/cypher-contracts)

## Setup Manually

1. Import the [`ICypherEscrow`](/contracts/interfaces/ICypherEscrow) and [`CypherProtocol`](/contracts/CypherProtocol) contracts into relevant protocol contracts

```solidity
import {ICypherEscrow} from "../../src/interfaces/ICypherEscrow.sol";
import {CypherProtocol} from "../../src/CypherProtocol.sol";
```

2. Inherit the [`CypherProtocol`](/contracts/CypherProtocol) contract in the relevant protocol contracts and pass in a `name` for the contract, a designated `architect` address, and the `registry` address from [here](/contracts/deployment-addresses)

```solidity
contract MockProtocol is CypherProtocol {
    constructor(address architect, address registry) CypherProtocol("MockProtocol", architect, registry) {}
}
```

3. Add the following lines to your withdraw function:

```solidity
// Contract.sol
function withdraw(address to, uint amount) external {
  ...
  ICypherEscrow escrow = ICypherEscrow(getEscrow());
  escrow.escrowETH{ value: ethBalances[msg.sender] }(msg.sender, msg.sender, 1);
  ...
}
```

4. You are good to go! Deploy your contracts, then fill their addresses in on the escrow page and grow your business!
