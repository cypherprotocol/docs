## Create Manually

Nextra works like a Next.js plugin, and it accepts a theme config (layout) to render the page. To start:

1. Locate the ICypherEscrow interface (right below this sentence):

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

interface ICypherEscrow {
    function escrowTokens(
        address from,
        address to,
        address asset,
        uint256 amount
    ) external;

    function escrowETH(address from, address to) external payable;
}
```

2. Import the `ICypherEscrow` interface into the contracts where function move any funds in and out:

```solidity
import {CypherProtocol} from "../../src/CypherProtocol.sol";

contract MockProtocol is CypherProtocol {
    constructor(address architect, address registry) CypherProtocol("MockProtocol", architect, registry) {}
}
```

3. Add the following lines to your withdraw function:

```solidity
// Contract.sol
function withdraw(address to, uint amount) external {
  ...
  ICypherEscrow escrow = ICypherEscrow(getEscrow());
  escrow.escrowETH{ value: ethBalances[msg.sender] }(msg.sender, msg.sender, 1);
  ...
}
```

4. You are good to go! Deploy your contracts, then fill their addresses in on the vault page and grow your business!
